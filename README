Beginnings of a small http server written using TCP primitives in Racket.

Usage:
1. install nix https://nixos.org/download
2. cd into this repository and run `nix-shell`
3. run `racket simple-http.rkt`

Alternatively, skip step (1) and use your preferred package
manager (e.g. brew, apt-get, etc.).

One can test the server by running `telnet localhost <port-no>` where
the port number is reported by the server when run.

Implementation information:
* [Sep 17 '23] awaiting an arbitrary number of TCP connections is implemented
* [TODO] implementation of HTTP/1.x is not yet completed
